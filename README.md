# 📌 Data Structures & Algorithms in Java

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository built entirely using **Java**.  
This repository is structured to strengthen core DSA concepts with clean, modular, and interview-ready implementations, suitable for students, professionals, and competitive programmers.
